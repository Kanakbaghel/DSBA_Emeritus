### The Foundation of Practical Data Science

---

## 📌 Overview

The **Theory & Tools** section forms the **core foundation** of Data Science learning.
It bridges the gap between **conceptual understanding** and **hands-on implementation**, ensuring that every tool is learned with **clear theoretical reasoning**.

> Tools without theory lead to shallow learning.
> Theory without tools lacks real-world relevance.
> **This folder integrates both.**

---

## 🎯 Objective of This Section

This section is designed to help learners:

* Build **strong conceptual clarity**
* Understand **why a technique works**, not just how
* Apply theory using **industry-relevant tools**
* Develop **analytical and problem-solving thinking**
* Progress from **beginner to advanced proficiency**

---

## 🧩 Structure & Learning Philosophy

Each sub-folder follows a **three-layer learning approach**:

1. **Theory** – Core concepts, definitions, logic
2. **Tools** – Practical implementation using software & libraries
3. **Practice** – Application through notebooks, queries, and analysis

This ensures **depth, consistency, and long-term retention**.
